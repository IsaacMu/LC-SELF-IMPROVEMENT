# 122.Â Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock II

Say you have an array for which the *i*th element is the price of a given stock on day *i*.

Design an algorithm to find the maximum profit. You may complete as many transactions as you like (i.e., buy one and sell one share of the stock multiple times).

**Note:** You may not engage in multiple transactions at the same time (i.e., you must sell the stock before you buy again).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: [7,1,5,3,6,4]
Output: 7
Explanation: Buy on day 2 (price = 1) and sell on day 3 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Then buy on day 4 (price = 3) and sell on day 5 (price = 6), profit = 6-3 = 3.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: [1,2,3,4,5]
Output: 4
Explanation: Buy on day 1 (price = 1) and sell on day 5 (price = 5), profit = 5-1 = 4.
             Note that you cannot buy on day 1, buy on day 2 and sell them later, as you are
             engaging multiple transactions at the same time. You must sell before buying again.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: [7,6,4,3,1]
Output: 0
Explanation: In this case, no transaction is done, i.e. max profit = 0.
```

# Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxProfit(int[] prices) {
        int max = 0;
        int pointS = 0;
        int pointE = 0;
        for(int i = 1; i < prices.length && pointS < prices.length; i++){
            if(prices[i] <= prices[pointS]) {
                pointS = i;
                continue;
            }
            pointE = i;
            for(int j = i + 1; j < prices.length; j++) {
                if(prices[j] >= prices[pointE]) {
                    pointE = j;
                    if(pointE != prices.length - 1) continue;
                }
                break;
            }
            max += prices[pointE] - prices[pointS];
            pointS = pointE + 1;
            i = pointE + 1;
        }
        return max;
    }
}
```

Time is O(n2) Space is O(1)

# Wrong point

1. if pointEnd is the last one, forget to add the num
2. if pointE is the last one, should not continue
3. i forget to keep same as pointS

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        total = 0
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            total += max(prices[i] - prices[i-1], 0)
        return total
```

Time for O(n), Space for O(1)

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int]) -> int:
        # total = 0
        # for i in range(1, len(prices)):
        #     total += max(prices[i] - prices[i-1], 0)
        # return total
        n = len(prices)
        if n == 1:
            return 0
        dp = [[0] * 2 for _ in range(n)]
        dp[0][0] = -prices[0] # 0th day holding stock max cash
        dp[0][1] = 0 # 0th day without holding stock max cash
        for i in range(1, n):
            dp[i][0] = max(dp[i-1][0], dp[i-1][1] - prices[i])
            dp[i][1] = max(dp[i-1][0] + prices[i], dp[i-1][1])
        return dp[n-1][1]
