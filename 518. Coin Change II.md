# 518. Coin Change II

```python
class Solution:
    def change(self, amount: int, coins: List[int]) -> int:
        dp = [0] * (amount+1)
        dp[0] = 1
        for coin in coins:
            for j in range(coin, amount+1):
                # dp[j] means to reach amount j, there is dp[j]way
                dp[j] += dp[j-coin]
        return dp[amount]
```


O(nâ‹…amount), O(amount)
