# 714. Best Time to Buy and Sell Stock with Transaction Fee

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def maxProfit(self, prices: List[int], fee: int) -> int:
        dp = [0] * 2
        #dp[0] holding stock most money
        #dp[1] without holding stock most money
        dp[0] = -prices[0]
        for i in range(1, len(prices)):
            temp = dp[0]
            dp[0] = max(dp[0], dp[1]-prices[i])
            dp[1] = max(dp[1], temp-fee+prices[i])
        return dp[1]
```
Space is O(1), Time is O(n) when n is length of prices list.
