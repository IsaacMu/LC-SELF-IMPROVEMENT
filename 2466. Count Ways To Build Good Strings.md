# 2466. Count Ways To Build Good Strings

```python

class Solution:
    def countGoodStrings(self, low: int, high: int, zero: int, one: int) -> int:
        dp = [0 for _ in range(high+1)]
        dp[0] = 1
        for i in range(high+1):
            if i - zero >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i-zero]
            if i - one >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i-one]
        return sum(dp[low:high+1]) % (10 ** 9 + 7)
```

1. Time Complexity is O(High), space Complexity is O(High)
