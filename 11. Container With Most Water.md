#11. Container With Most Water

```java
class Solution {
    public int maxArea(int[] height) {
        int n = height.length;
        int max = 0;
        int left = 0;
        int right = n - 1;
        while(left < right) {
            max = Math.max(max, Math.min(height[left], height[right]) * (right - left));
            if(height[left] < height[right]) {
                left++;
            } else right--;
        }
        return max;
        
        
    }
}

# Worth point 

1. dont always go with expand but need to try to minus the bound
2. need think better
3. Time is O(n) Space is O(1)
