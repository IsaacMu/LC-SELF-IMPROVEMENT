# 278.Â First Bad Version

You are a product manager and currently leading a team to develop a new product. Unfortunately, the latest version of your product fails the quality check. Since each version is developed based on the previous version, all the versions after a bad version are also bad.

Suppose you have `n` versions `[1, 2, ..., n]` and you want to find out the first bad one, which causes all the following ones to be bad.

You are given an API `bool isBadVersion(version)` which will return whether `version` is bad. Implement a function to find the first bad version. You should minimize the number of calls to the API.

**Example:**

```
Given n = 5, and version = 4 is the first bad version.

call isBadVersion(3) -> false
call isBadVersion(5) -> true
call isBadVersion(4) -> true

Then 4 is the first bad version. 
```

# Solution

```java
/* The isBadVersion API is defined in the parent class VersionControl.
      boolean isBadVersion(int version); */

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        while(left < right){
            int t = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if(isBadVersion(t) == true){
                right = t;
            }else {
                left = t + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}

public class Solution extends VersionControl {
    public int firstBadVersion(int n) {
        int left = 1;
        int right = n;
        while(left <= right){
            int t = left + (right - left) / 2;
            if(isBadVersion(t) == true){
                right = t - 1;
            }else {
                left = t + 1;
            }
        }
        return left;
    }
}

```

Time is O(logn) Space is O(1)

# Wrong point 

while loop and relate left and right.


```python
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        l, r = 0, n
        while l < r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if isBadVersion(m):
                r = m
            else:
                l = m + 1
        return l
```

```python
class Solution:
    def firstBadVersion(self, n: int) -> int:
        l, r = -1, n
        while l+1 < r:
            m = (l + r) // 2
            if isBadVersion(m):
                r = m
            else:
                l = m
        return r
