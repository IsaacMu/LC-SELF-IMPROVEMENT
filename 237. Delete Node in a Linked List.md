#237.Â Delete Node in a Linked List
in fact, i thought it need to free the malloc, so i need two pointer, however, it doesn't in Java

# Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public void deleteNode(ListNode node) {
        if(node == null) return;
        node.val = node.next.val;
        node.next = node.next.next;
    }
}
```
