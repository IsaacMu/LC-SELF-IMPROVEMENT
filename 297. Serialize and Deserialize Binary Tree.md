# 297. Serialize and Deserialize Binary Tree
Serialization is the process of converting a data structure or object into a sequence of bits so that it can be stored in a file or memory buffer, or transmitted across a network connection link to be reconstructed later in the same or another computer environment.

Design an algorithm to serialize and deserialize a binary tree. There is no restriction on how your serialization/deserialization algorithm should work. You just need to ensure that a binary tree can be serialized to a string and this string can be deserialized to the original tree structure.

Clarification: The input/output format is the same as how LeetCode serializes a binary tree. You do not necessarily need to follow this format, so please be creative and come up with different approaches yourself. 

Input: root = [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]
Output: [1,2,3,null,null,4,5]

Input: root = []
Output: []
# Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode(object):
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.left = None
#         self.right = None

class Codec:

    def serialize(self, root):
        """Encodes a tree to a single string.
        
        :type root: TreeNode
        :rtype: str
        """
        res = ""
        queue = [root]
        while len(queue) != 0:
            e = queue.pop(0)
            if e:
                res += str(e.val) + ","
            else:
                res += "null,"
            if e:
                queue.append(e.left)
                queue.append(e.right)
        return res

    def deserialize(self, data):
        """Decodes your encoded data to tree.
        
        :type data: str
        :rtype: TreeNode
        """
        nodes = data.split(',')
        if nodes[0] == 'null':
            return None
        root = TreeNode(nodes[0])
        queue = [root]
        i = 1
        while len(queue) != 0:
            if nodes[i] != 'null':
                queue[0].left = TreeNode(int(nodes[i]))
                queue.append(queue[0].left)
            else:
                queue[0].left = None
            i += 1
            if nodes[i] != 'null':
                queue[0].right = TreeNode(int(nodes[i]))
                queue.append(queue[0].right)
            else:
                queue[0].right = None
            i += 1
            queue.pop(0)     
        return root
