# 202. Happy Number

------
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

    Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
    Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a cycle which does not include 1.
    Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.

Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isHappy(self, n: int) -> bool:
        record = set()
        def helper(n):
            res = 0
            while n:
                n, r = divmod(n, 10)
                res += r**2
            return res
        while True:
            n = helper(n)
            if n == 1:
                return True
            if n in record:
                return False
            record.add(n)
```

1. can use fast and slow two pointer for loop.
2. divmod function for python
