#167.Â Two Sum II - Input array is sorted

------

Given an array of integers that is already **sorted in ascending order**, find two numbers such that they add up to a specific target number.

The function twoSum should return indices of the two numbers such that they add up to the target, where index1 must be less than index2.

**Note:**

- Your returned answers (both index1 and index2) are not zero-based.
- You may assume that each input would have *exactly* one solution and you may not use the *same* element twice.

**Example:**

```
Input: numbers = [2,7,11,15], target = 9
Output: [1,2]
Explanation: The sum of 2 and 7 is 9. Therefore index1 = 1, index2 = 2.
```

# Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int[] twoSum(int[] numbers, int target) {
        int index1,index2 = 1;
        for(index1 = 0; index1 < numbers.length; index1++){
            for(index2 = index1 + 1; index2 < numbers.length; index2++) {
                if(numbers[index1] + numbers[index2] > target) break;
                if(numbers[index1] + numbers[index2] == target) {
                    int re[]= {index1+1,index2+1};
                    return re;
                }
            }
        }
        return null;
    }
}
```

Time is O(n2) Space is O(2),worst answer.
