# 1347. Minimum Number of Steps to Make Two Strings Anagram

```python

class Solution:
    def minSteps(self, s: str, t: str) -> int:
        count = [0] * 26

        for char in s:
            count[ord(char) - ord('a')] += 1

        for char in t:
            count[ord(char) - ord('a')] -= 1

        return sum(val for val in count if val > 0)
```
# Notes

1. Time Complexity is O(N), space Complexity is O(1)
