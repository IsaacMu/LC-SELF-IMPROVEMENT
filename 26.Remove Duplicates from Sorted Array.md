# 26.Remove Duplicates from Sorted Array

Given a sorted array *nums*, remove the duplicates [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm) such that each element appear only *once* and return the new length.

Do not allocate extra space for another array, you must do this by **modifying the input array in-place** with O(1) extra memory.

**Example 1:**

```
Given nums = [1,1,2],

Your function should return length = 2, with the first two elements of nums being 1 and 2 respectively.

It doesn't matter what you leave beyond the returned length.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given nums = [0,0,1,1,1,2,2,3,3,4],

Your function should return length = 5, with the first five elements of nums being modified to 0, 1, 2, 3, and 4 respectively.

It doesn't matter what values are set beyond the returned length.
```

**Clarification:**

Confused why the returned value is an integer but your answer is an array?

Note that the input array is passed in by **reference**, which means modification to the input array will be known to the caller as well.

Internally you can think of this:

```
// nums is passed in by reference. (i.e., without making a copy)
int len = removeDuplicates(nums);

// any modification to nums in your function would be known by the caller.
// using the length returned by your function, it prints the first len elements.
for (int i = 0; i < len; i++) {
    print(nums[i]);
}
```



# Solution

```Java
class Solution {
    public int removeDuplicates(int[] nums) {
        int index = 0;
        for (int i = 1; i < nums.length; i++) {
            if(nums[index] != nums[i]) {
                index++;
                nums[index] = nums[i];
            }
        }
        if (nums.length == 0) return 0;
        return index + 1;
    }
}
```

if different, need to change nums[++index]. and length is index+1 not index.

# Better

```Java
public int removeDuplicates(int[] A) {
    if (A.length==0) return 0;
    int j=0;
    for (int i=0; i<A.length; i++)
        if (A[i]!=A[j]) A[++j]=A[i];
    return ++j;
}
```



# Complexity

Space is O(1) Time is O(n)



# Missing point

forget length of 0


## Complex version if three arrays here
```python
class Solution:
    def removeThreeDuplicates(self, nums1, nums2, nums3):
        res = []
        p1 = nums1[0]
        p2 = nums2[0]
        p3 = nums3[0]
        heap = []
        nums = [nums1, nums2, nums3]
        heapq.heappush(heap, (nums1[0], 0, 0))
        heapq.heappush(heap, (nums2[0], 1, 0))
        heapq.heappush(heap, (nums3[0], 2, 0))
        while heap:
            e, i, index = heapq.heappop(heap)
            if res and e != res[-1]:
                res.append(e)
            if index < len(nums[i]):
                heapq.heappush(heap, (nums[i][index+1], i, index+1))
        return res
            
```
