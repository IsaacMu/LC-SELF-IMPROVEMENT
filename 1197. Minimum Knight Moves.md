# 1197. Minimum Knight Moves

```python
class Solution:
    def minKnightMoves(self, x: int, y: int) -> int:
        directions = [(2, 1), (2, -1), (1, 2), (1, -2), (-2, 1), (-2, -1), (-1, 2), (-1, -2)]
        visited = {}
        queue = collections.deque()
        queue.append((0,0,0))
        while queue:
            i, j, count = queue.popleft()
            if i == x and j == y:
                return count
            for di, dj in directions:
                ni, nj = i+di, j+dj
                if (ni,nj) not in visited:
                    visited[(ni,nj)] = True
                    queue.append((ni, nj, count+1))

# Notes

1. Time Complexity is O(N2), space Complexity is O(N2),

2. We can improve by pure math in O(1)
