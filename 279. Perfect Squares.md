# 279. Perfect Squares

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def numSquares(self, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [float('inf')] * (n+1)
        dp[0] = 0
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            basic = 1
            e = basic * basic
            while e <= i:
                dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i-e] + 1)
                basic += 1
                e = basic * basic
        return dp[n]

```
