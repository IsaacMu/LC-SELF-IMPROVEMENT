# 62. Unique Paths

```python
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0 for _ in range(n+1)] for _ in range(m+1)]
        dp[0][1] = 1
        for row in range(1, m+1):
            for col in range(1, n+1):
                dp[row][col] = dp[row-1][col] + dp[row][col-1]
        return dp[m][n]
```

# Notes

1. time complexity is O(n*m) space is O(n * m)
