# 1002. Find Common Characters
Given a string array words, return an array of all characters that show up in all strings within the words (including duplicates). You may return the answer in any order. 

```python
class Solution:
    def commonChars(self, words: List[str]) -> List[str]:
        temp = Counter(words[0])
        res = []
        for i in range(1, len(words)):
            temp = temp & Counter(words[i])
        for ch in temp:
            for i in range(temp[ch]):
                res.append(ch)
        return res
```
