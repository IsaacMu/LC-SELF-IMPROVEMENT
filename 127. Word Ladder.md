# 127. Word Ladder

------
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

    Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
    Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
    sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

Example 2:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.


# Solution

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        if endWord not in wordList or not endWord or not beginWord or not wordList:
            return 0
        L = len(beginWord)
        all_combo_dict = defaultdict(list)
        for word in wordList:
            for i in range(L):
                all_combo_dict[word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]].append(word)
        queue = collections.deque([(beginWord, 1)])
        visited = {beginWord: True}
        while queue:
            current_word, level = queue.popleft()
            for i in range(L):
                temp = current_word[:i] + '*' + current_word[i+1:]
                for word in all_combo_dict[temp]:
                    if word == endWord:
                        return level + 1
                    if word not in visited:
                        queue.append((word, level+1))
                        visited[word] = True
        return 0
            
```


```python
class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        wordList = set(wordList)
        L = len(endWord)
        if endWord not in wordList:
            return 0
        visited = set([beginWord])
        queue = deque([beginWord])
        count = 1
        while queue:
            next_queue = deque()
            while queue:

                for j in range(26):
                    for i in range(L):
                        word = temp[:i] + chr(ord('a')+j) + temp[i+1:]
                        if word == endWord:
                            return count + 1
                        if word in visited:
                            continue
                        if word in wordList:
                            visited.add(word)
                            next_queue.append(word)
            count += 1
            queue = next_queue
        return 0
            
```
# Note:
BFS way, important thing is only 26 way to become new word, not for loop the wordlist.

Another thing is we can push level parameter to skip two while loop here.
