# 127. Word Ladder

------
A transformation sequence from word beginWord to word endWord using a dictionary wordList is a sequence of words beginWord -> s1 -> s2 -> ... -> sk such that:

    Every adjacent pair of words differs by a single letter.
    Every si for 1 <= i <= k is in wordList. Note that beginWord does not need to be in wordList.
    sk == endWord

Given two words, beginWord and endWord, and a dictionary wordList, return the number of words in the shortest transformation sequence from beginWord to endWord, or 0 if no such sequence exists.

 

Example 1:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log","cog"]
Output: 5
Explanation: One shortest transformation sequence is "hit" -> "hot" -> "dot" -> "dog" -> cog", which is 5 words long.

Example 2:

Input: beginWord = "hit", endWord = "cog", wordList = ["hot","dot","dog","lot","log"]
Output: 0
Explanation: The endWord "cog" is not in wordList, therefore there is no valid transformation sequence.

```python
from collections import defaultdict

class Solution:
    def ladderLength(self, beginWord: str, endWord: str, wordList: List[str]) -> int:
        if endWord not in wordList or not endWord or not beginWord or not wordList:
            return 0
        L = len(beginWord)
        all_combo_dict = defaultdict(list)
        for word in wordList:
            for i in range(L):
                all_combo_dict[word[:i] + "*" + word[i+1:]].append(word)
        queue = collections.deque([(beginWord, 1)])
        visited = {beginWord: True}
        while queue:
            current_word, level = queue.popleft()
            for i in range(L):
                temp = current_word[:i] + '*' + current_word[i+1:]
                for word in all_combo_dict[temp]:
                    if word == endWord:
                        return level + 1
                    if word not in visited:
                        queue.append((word, level+1))
                        visited[word] = True
        return 0
