# 2533. Number of Good Binary Strings

```python
class Solution:
    def goodBinaryStrings(self, minLength: int, maxLength: int, oneGroup: int, zeroGroup: int) -> int:
        dp = [0 for _ in range(maxLength+1)]
        dp[0] = 1
        for i in range(1, maxLength+1):
            # for j in range(oneGroup):
            if i - oneGroup >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i-oneGroup]
            # for j in range(zeroGroup):
            if i - zeroGroup >= 0:
                dp[i] += dp[i-zeroGroup]
        mod = 10 ** 9 + 7
        return sum(dp[minLength:maxLength+1]) % mod
```

1. Time Complexity is O(High), space Complexity is O(High)
