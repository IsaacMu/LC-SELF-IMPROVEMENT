```python 
class Solution:
    def buddyStrings(self, s: str, goal: str) -> bool:
        if len(s) != len(goal):
            return False
        if s == goal and len(set(s)) < len(s):
            return True
        diffs = [(a,b) for a, b in zip(s, goal) if a != b]
        return len(diffs) == 2 and diffs[0] == diffs[1][::-1]
