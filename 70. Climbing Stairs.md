# 70. Climbing Stairs

You are climbing a stair case. It takes *n* steps to reach to the top.

Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

**Note:** Given *n* will be a positive integer.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 2
Output: 2
Explanation: There are two ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step
2. 2 steps
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 3
Output: 3
Explanation: There are three ways to climb to the top.
1. 1 step + 1 step + 1 step
2. 1 step + 2 steps
3. 2 steps + 1 step
```

# Solution

```Java
class Solution {
    public int climbStairs(int n) {
        if (n == 1) return 1;
        if (n == 0) return 1;
        int[] temp = new int[n];
        temp[0] = 1;
        temp[1] = 1;
        for(int i = 2; i < n; i++) {
            temp[i] = temp[i-1] + temp[i-2];
        }   
        return temp[n-1]+temp[n-2];
    }
}
```

Time is O(n) Space is O(logn)

at first, use only recursion, but the time will exceed the limit.

# Wrong Point

1. n == 1 & n ==2 . but infact, 2 is not special ,0 is.
2. negative don't consider

# Better one

T2 =T1+T2 T1= T2-T1 with only o(1)



In fact, there is a general term formula for fibonacci sequenceâ€¦
