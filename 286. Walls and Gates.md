# 286. Walls and Gates



# Solution

```python
class Solution:
  def wallsAndGates(self, rooms: List[List[int]]) -> None:
    queue = queue.deque()
    m, n = len(rooms), len(rooms[0])
    for i in range(m):
        for j in range(n):
            if rooms[i][j] == 0:
                queue.append((i, j, 0))
    directions = [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]
    while queue:
        x, y, count = queue.popleft()
        for dx, dy in directions:
            nx, ny = x+dx, y+dy
            if nx >= 0 and nx < m and ny >=0 and ny < n and rooms[nx][ny] == float('inf'):
                rooms[nx][ny] = count+1
                queue.append((nx, ny, count+1))
```
The count can be found in `rooms[x][y]`

Time Complexity is O(n*M). Space Complexity is O(1)
