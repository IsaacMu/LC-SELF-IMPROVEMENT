# 452. Minimum Number of Arrows to Burst Balloons

# Solution

```Python
class Solution:
    def findMinArrowShots(self, points: List[List[int]]) -> int:
        total = 1
        points.sort(key=lambda x: x[0])
        cur = None
        for point in points:
            if not cur:
                cur = point[1]
            elif point[0] > cur:
                total += 1
                cur = point[1]
            else:
                cur = min(cur, point[1])
        return total
```
