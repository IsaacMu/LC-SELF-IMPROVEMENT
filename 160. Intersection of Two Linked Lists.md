# 160. Intersection of Two Linked Lists
Given the heads of two singly linked-lists headA and headB, return the node at which the two lists intersect. If the two linked lists have no intersection at all, return null.
# Solution

```python
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> Optional[ListNode]:
        pa = headA
        pb = headB
        while pa != pb:
            pa = headB if pa is None else pa.next
            pb = headA if pb is None else pb.next
        return pa
```

Time Complexity is O(N+M) space is O(1)

Trick: 
1. use two pointer by connecting two link together.
