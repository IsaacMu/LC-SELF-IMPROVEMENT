# 242. Valid Anagram
Given two strings s and t, return true if t is an anagram of s, and false otherwise.

An Anagram is a word or phrase formed by rearranging the letters of a different word or phrase, typically using all the original letters exactly once.


# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isAnagram(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        counter_s = Counter(s)
        counter_t = Counter(t)
        if len(counter_s) == len(counter_t):
            for key in counter_s:
                if counter_s.get(key) != counter_t.get(key, 0):
                    return False
        else:
            return False
        return True
```
