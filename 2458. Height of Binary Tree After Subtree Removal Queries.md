# 2458. Height of Binary Tree After Subtree Removal Queries
You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is assigned a unique value from 1 to n. You are also given an array queries of size m.

You have to perform m independent queries on the tree where in the ith query you do the following:

    Remove the subtree rooted at the node with the value queries[i] from the tree. It is guaranteed that queries[i] will not be equal to the value of the root.

Return an array answer of size m where answer[i] is the height of the tree after performing the ith query.

Note:

    The queries are independent, so the tree returns to its initial state after each query.
    The height of a tree is the number of edges in the longest simple path from the root to some node in the tree.


```python

# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def treeQueries(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], queries: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        @lru_cache(None)
        def height(node):
            if node == None:
                return -1
            left_height = height(node.left)
            right_height = height(node.right)
            return max(left_height, right_height) + 1
        dict1 = collections.defaultdict(int)
        def dfs(node, depth, max_val):
            if not node:
                return
            dict1[node.val] = max_val
            dfs(node.left, depth+1, max(max_val, depth+1+height(node.right)))
            dfs(node.right, depth+1, max(max_val, depth+1+height(node.left)))
        dfs(root, 0, 0)

        return [dict1[i] for i in queries]
```
