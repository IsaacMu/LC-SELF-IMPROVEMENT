# 239. Sliding Window Maximum
You are given an array of integers nums, there is a sliding window of size k which is moving from the very left of the array to the very right. You can only see the k numbers in the window. Each time the sliding window moves right by one position.

Return the max sliding window.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,3,-1,-3,5,3,6,7], k = 3
Output: [3,3,5,5,6,7]
Explanation: 
Window position                Max
---------------               -----
[1  3  -1] -3  5  3  6  7       3
 1 [3  -1  -3] 5  3  6  7       3
 1  3 [-1  -3  5] 3  6  7       5
 1  3  -1 [-3  5  3] 6  7       5
 1  3  -1  -3 [5  3  6] 7       6
 1  3  -1  -3  5 [3  6  7]      7

Example 2:

Input: nums = [1], k = 1
Output: [1]


# Solution

```python
from collections import deque

class Solution:
    def maxSlidingWindow(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> List[int]:
        n = len(nums)
        if n * k == 0:
            return []
        if k == 1:
            return nums
        deq = deque()
        max_idx = 0
        def clean_deque(i):
            # remove indexes of elements not from sliding window
            if deq and deq[0] == i - k:
                deq.popleft()
                
            # remove from deq indexes of all elements 
            # which are smaller than current element nums[i]
            while deq and nums[i] > nums[deq[-1]]:
                deq.pop()        
        i = 0
        while i < k:
            clean_deque(i)
            deq.append(i)
            if nums[i] > nums[max_idx]:
                max_idx = i
            i+= 1
        output = [nums[max_idx]]
        
        while i < n:
            clean_deque(i)
            deq.append(i)
            output.append(nums[deq[0]])
            i += 1
        return output
```

# Note:
- Try DP scan max from left and right.
