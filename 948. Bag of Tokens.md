# 948. Bag of Tokens

```python
class Solution:
    def bagOfTokensScore(self, tokens: List[int], power: int) -> int:
        max_score, cur_score = 0, 0
        tokens = sorted(tokens)
        l = 0
        n = len(tokens)
        r = n - 1
        while l <= r and cur_score >= 0:
            while l < n and power >= tokens[l]:
                power -= tokens[l]
                cur_score += 1
                max_score = max(max_score, cur_score)
                l += 1
            if cur_score >= 0:
                cur_score -= 1
