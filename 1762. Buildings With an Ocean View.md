# 1762. Buildings With an Ocean View

```python

class Solution:
    def findBuildings(self, heights: List[int]) -> List[int]:
        stack = []

        for i in range(heights):
            while stack and heights[i] >= stack[-1]:
                stack.pop()
            stack.append(i)
        return stack
```
# Notes

1. Time Complexity is O(N), space Complexity is O(n)
