# 191.Â Number of 1 Bits

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer and returns the number of '1' bits it has (also known as the [Hamming weight](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_weight)).

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 11
Output: 3
Explanation: Integer 11 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000000001011 
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 128
Output: 1
Explanation: Integer 128 has binary representation 00000000000000000000000010000000
```

# Solution

```java
public class Solution {
    // you need to treat n as an unsigned value
    public int hammingWeight(int n) {
        int re = 0;
        while(n != 0) {
            if((n & 1) == 1) re++;
            n = n >>> 1;
        }
        return re;
    }
}
```

Time is O(n) Space is O(1)

# Wrong point

n as unsigned , so cannot use %  and /= 2;
