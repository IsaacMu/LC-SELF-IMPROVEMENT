# 48. Rotate Image

You are given an *n* x *n* 2D matrix representing an image.

Rotate the image by 90 degrees (clockwise).

**Note:**

You have to rotate the image [**in-place**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/In-place_algorithm), which means you have to modify the input 2D matrix directly. **DO NOT** allocate another 2D matrix and do the rotation.

**Example 1:**

```
Given input matrix = 
[
  [1,2,3],
  [4,5,6],
  [7,8,9]
],

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [7,4,1],
  [8,5,2],
  [9,6,3]
]
```

**Example 2:**

```
Given input matrix =
[
  [ 5, 1, 9,11],
  [ 2, 4, 8,10],
  [13, 3, 6, 7],
  [15,14,12,16]
], 

rotate the input matrix in-place such that it becomes:
[
  [15,13, 2, 5],
  [14, 3, 4, 1],
  [12, 6, 8, 9],
  [16, 7,10,11]
]
```



# Solution

```Java
class Solution {
    public void rotate(int[][] matrix) {
        int n = matrix[0].length;
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            for(int j = i; j < n; j++) {
                int temp = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[j][i];
                matrix[j][i] = temp;
            }
        }
        for(int i = 0; i < n; i++){
            for(int j = 0; j < n/2; j++){
                int temp = matrix[i][j];
                matrix[i][j] = matrix[i][n-j-1];
                matrix[i][n-j-1] = temp;
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In fact, I don't have idea at first. then I find out it is more easy to rotate across the diagonal and then up side down.

Time Complexity is O(n2) while Space is O(1)
