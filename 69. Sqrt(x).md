#69.Â Sqrt(x)

implement `int sqrt(int x)`.

Compute and return the square root of *x*, where *x* is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer.

Since the return type is an integer, the decimal digits are truncated and only the integer part of the result is returned.

**Example 1:**

```
Input: 4
Output: 2
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: 8
Output: 2
Explanation: The square root of 8 is 2.82842..., and since 
             the decimal part is truncated, 2 is returned.
```

#  Solution

```java
class Solution {
    public int mySqrt(int x) {
        if(x == 0) return 0;
        if(x == 2) return 1;
        if(x == 3) return 1;
        if(x == 4) return 2;
        int re = 1;
        while(re < x){
            if(re * re > x || re * re < 0) return re - 1;
            re++;
        }
        return re;
    }
}
```

Time is O(n) space is O(1)

# Wrong point

have to think about the initial case.
