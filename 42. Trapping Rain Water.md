# 42. Trapping Rain Water
Given n non-negative integers representing an elevation map where the width of each bar is 1, compute how much water it can trap after raining.

```python
class Solution:
    def trap(self, height: List[int]) -> int:
        lp = 0
        rp = 1
        total = 0
        n = len(height)
        left_max = [0 for i in range(n)]
        left_max[0] = height[0]
        for i in range(1, n, 1):
            left_max[i] = max(height[i], left_max[i-1])
        right_max = [0 for i in range(n)]
        right_max[-1] = height[-1]
        for i in range(n-2, -1, -1):
            right_max[i] = max(height[i], right_max[i+1])
        for i in range(1, n-1, 1):
            total += min(right_max[i], left_max[i]) - height[i]
        return total
        
```

# Notes

1. Time Complexity is O(n), Space Complexity is O(n)
2. use two pointer can reduce space complexity to O(1)
