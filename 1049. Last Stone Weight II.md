# 1049. Last Stone Weight II

```python
class Solution:
    def lastStoneWeightII(self, stones: List[int]) -> int:
        total = sum(stones)
        target = total//2
        dp = [0] * (target+1)
        for stone in stones:
            for i in range(target, stone-1, -1):
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[i-stone] + stone)
        
        return total - dp[target] - dp[target]
```

1. If ask optimize space complexity to O(1), can try to make two pointer do inner change.
