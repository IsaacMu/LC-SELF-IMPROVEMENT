# 392. Is Subsequence

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        n, m = len(s), len(t)
        dp = [[0] * (m+1) for _ in range(n+1)]
        # dp[i][j] s[:i-1], t[:j-1] max subsequence length
        for i in range(1, n+1):
            for j in range(1, m+1):
                if s[i-1] == t[j-1]:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j-1] + 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[n][m] == n
```
Time is O(N*M), Space is O(M*N)

```python
class Solution:
    def isSubsequence(self, s: str, t: str) -> bool:
        LEFT_BOUND, RIGHT_BOUND = len(s), len(t)

        p_left = p_right = 0
        while p_left < LEFT_BOUND and p_right < RIGHT_BOUND:
            # move both pointers or just the right pointer
            if s[p_left] == t[p_right]:
                p_left += 1
            p_right += 1

        return p_left == LEFT_BOUND
```
Better Solution, Time is O(M+N), Space is O(1)
