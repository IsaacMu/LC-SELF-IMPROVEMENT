# 222. Count Complete Tree Nodes

Given the root of a complete binary tree, return the number of the nodes in the tree.

According to Wikipedia, every level, except possibly the last, is completely filled in a complete binary tree, and all nodes in the last level are as far left as possible. It can have between 1 and 2h nodes inclusive at the last level h.

Design an algorithm that runs in less than O(n) time complexity.



# Solution

```python
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def helper(self, node):
        if not node:
            return 0
        left = self.helper(node.left)
        right = self.helper(node.right)
        return left + right + 1
    
    def countNodes(self, root: Optional[TreeNode]) -> int:
        return self.helper(root)    
```
Time is O(n), Space is O(1)

# Wrong point

Best Idea is using binary on binary
