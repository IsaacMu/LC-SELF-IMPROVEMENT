# 647. Palindromic Substrings

# Solution

```python
class Solution:
    def countSubstrings(self, s: str) -> int:
        res = 0
        n = len(s)
        dp = [[False] * n for _ in range(n)]
        for i in range(n-1, -1, -1):
            for j in range(i, n):
                if s[i] == s[j] and (j - i <= 1 or dp[i+1][j-1]):
                    res += 1
                    dp[i][j] = True
        return res

```

Time Complexity is O(n^2), Space is O(n^2)

if use two pointer to extend search the palindromic, will reduce space to O(1)
