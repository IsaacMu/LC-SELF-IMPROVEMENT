# 637. Average of Levels in Binary Tree

Given a non-empty binary tree, return the average value of the nodes on each level in the form of an array.

**Example 1:**

```
Input:
    3
   / \
  9  20
    /  \
   15   7
Output: [3, 14.5, 11]
Explanation:
The average value of nodes on level 0 is 3,  on level 1 is 14.5, and on level 2 is 11. Hence return [3, 14.5, 11].
```

**Note:**

1. The range of node's value is in the range of 32-bit signed integer.

# Solution

```Java
class Solution {

    public List<Double> averageOfLevels(TreeNode root) {
        List<Double> result = new ArrayList();
        Queue<TreeNode> list = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();
        if (root == null) return result;
        list.add(root);
        while (!list.isEmpty()) {
            int count = list.size();
            double sum = 0;
            for (int i = 0; i < count; i++) {
                TreeNode temp = list.poll();
                if (temp.left != null) list.add(temp.left);
                if (temp.right != null) list.add(temp.right);
                sum += temp.val;
            }
            result.add(sum/count);
        }
        return result;
    }
}



```

# Algorithm:

BFS, use a queue to save every node of a level.

# Grammar:

â€‹        Queue<TreeNode> list = new LinkedList<TreeNode>();

don't exist Queue<TreeNode> a = new Queue(); since Queue is abstract structure.

isEmpty(), size()    

use Poll() rather than remove(), use offer() rather than add(). Former functions are safer since they return null rather than throw an exception.

#Complexity
Time is O(n), Space is O(n)

#Mistake when finish
1. the val is int, but the sum need to be double.  -> make the [INT_MAX.INT_MAX.INT_MAX] answer wrong, since two INT_MAX will overflow.
2. don't use size but instead, add 1 each time it self will contribute strange answer. ===> for i < list.size() will contribute to the miscompute of size.
