# 1254. Number of Closed Islands
Given a 2D grid consists of 0s (land) and 1s (water).  An island is a maximal 4-directionally connected group of 0s and a closed island is an island totally (all left, top, right, bottom) surrounded by 1s.

Return the number of closed islands.

1. Time Complexity is O(M*N), space Complexity is O(M*N)
2. DFS and BFS
